## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

- TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Matplotlib (for plotting spectrograms)
- PyDub (for audio processing)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running code cells interactively)
##Resukts
  We manged to achieve 85% accuracy based on unseen data of IEEE competition.
